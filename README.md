fully functional, modern trading analytics dashboard tailored for active traders on Deriverse – the next-gen, fully on-chain Solana trading ecosystem supporting spot, perpetuals, and options markets. The tool serves as both a professional trading journal and portfolio analysis suite, empowering users to review performance, manage risk, and refine strategies with deep, actionable insights. All data is fetched directly from the Solana blockchain using the user's connected wallet (e.g., Phantom), ensuring decentralization, privacy, and real-time accuracy without relying on centralized APIs.
